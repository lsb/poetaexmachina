Flights of fancy in my younger and more vulnerable days: a few hundred lines of text-to-phoneme synthesis via a hundred lines of regexp substitutions.

Modifications since my bachelor's thesis:
* Scansion of any meter (master's work)
* Log-time word lemmatization scansion lookup, temp file cleanup (sqlite3 vs flat file)
