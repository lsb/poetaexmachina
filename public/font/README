This is Polutoniko LCD, a browser-based bitmap font for Ancient Greek.
It has been tested, and works, under Firefox 1.5 and IE 6.

The glyphs are copied from Verdana.  A Haskell 6.4 script converts the individual letters and accents into a full set of glyphs, and writes Javascript code to hint them.
The glyphs are GIFs, which Javascript strings together.

When writing a web page, instead of using a Unicode editor, it's possible to just write in beta code, enclosing all Greek within <ptlcd></ptlcd> tags.
Please see the proofsheet, also online at http://www.poetaexmachina.net/font/proofsheet/ , for details.
