This is Poeta ex Machina, a Text-to-Phoneme synthesizer for Latin poetry that uses MBROLA for speech synthesis.  The intonation is punctuation-based, not grammar-based, and the pronunciation is Classical.

The licensing terms of MBROLA is that it's only for non-commercial research purposes only, and not to be distributed, so it is therefore not included.
If you need to download the diphone database, it's http://poetaexmachina.net/i, the ITalian2 voice, and the executable is http://poetaexmachina.net/m.  

Please note that the original phoneme synthesis was 300 lines of gnu awk code, with 100 [sic] regular expression substitutions.
The scansion engine is entirely new Ruby 1.6.7 code, but it still uses textual data structures.
The word lookups are similarly new as well, borrowed from LiberStatim; it'd be possible to get some speedup by combining the input-text-to-scanned-text process into one longer Ruby script.
(No one's complained about the speed yet, so it stands as is.)

The PHP 4 web interface was praised for its simplicity at ACL 2005, where this was first introduced to the world.

(My final paper for Reid's Roman Satire class, in fall 2005, dealt with metrically analyzing Horace, Juvenal, et al, so the paper and related data are also included.)
